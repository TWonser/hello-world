Research log for week one of class

My name is Thomas Wonser I'm from Lawton, Oklahoma, and something interesting about me is that I was born on Valentines Day.

The inital understanding and assumption that I had when coming into this class was as follows that systems were to be used to write instuctional documents for the users or consumers of a product. I believe that my initial understanding very closely alligned with the actual defenition given within some of the documents we read outside the class to get a better understanding of the class.

When signing up and setting up my GitHub account I was unaware of what I was getting into with and the process I would have to take to set up my account as well as the process to setup a hello-world repository. When setting up the hello-world repository I noticed that the instructions were in an orderly manner and set up in way that if you were unaware of how to follow a certain instuction you would be assured later in the reading of a solution to your previous inquiry. Some of the key characteristics of the text were the visual representations of the instructions as well as the order in which the instructions are given.

The particular audience for The Programming Historian would be people interested in finding help in a technical manner on a subject or tools that they're unfamilliar with. The audience that the PierceHacker is focused towards is people looking for technical skill enhancers. The purpose of The Programming Historian is to learn technical processes. The purpose of the PierceHacker is to provide technical tutorials to Pierce College students. I believe that the designers of the websites chose the medium that they did being a public website because it's open to the public allowing alot of eyes to come to the pages without anyone being forced to leave their homes in order to recieve assistance.

looking back at this week in class I feel that I have learned how to operate on GitHub as well as I have been given a working defenition of what it means to be a technical writer in the current time.
