Research log for week one of class

My name is Thomas Wonser im from Lawton, OK something interesting about me is that I was born on Valentines Day.

The initai understanding and assumption that I had when coming into this class was as follows that the use of systems was being used to write instuctional documents for users or consumers of products. I believe that my initial understanding very closely alligned with the actual defenitions given within the documents we read in classs this week such defenitions can be seen in the reading (link) by (authors name).

When signing up and setting up my GitHub account I was unaware of what I was getting involved with and the measures I would have to take to set up my account as well as the process to setup a hello-world repository. When setting up the hello-world repository I noticed that the instructions were in an orderly manner and set up in way that if you were unaware of how to follow a certain instuction you would be assured later in the reading. Some of the key characteristics of the text were the visual representations of the instuctions as well as the order in which the instuctions are given.

(fourth body paragraph repsonce insert here)

looking back at this week in class I feel that I have learned how to operate on GitHub as well as I have been given a working defenition of what it means to be a technical writer in the current time.
