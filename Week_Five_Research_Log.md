Research log for week five of class

My process when coming up with how to approach writing this analytical report was kind of challenging as I hadn't ever written a report of this style for school before in any English or communications class, as most of my work has been mostly unformalized papers but with similar number of pages as seen in the suggested amount for this assignment. My process started with me looking up many reference documents to get a general idea of what I was going to have to do for this project and it was especially helpful having all the data already done for this project.

I can't answer to the other prompts as I wasn't present in class the day other students received feedback on their reports.
