Research log for week three of class

This week in class we as a collective are trying to formulate a survey to be distributed to classes within the college in order to find out particular areas in which students use certain applications for schooling and the amount of time that is spent in or to finish their work or the amount of time for a time period that they use certain programs.

The particular audience for the Pierce Hacker project is students at pierce that need assistance in schooling or just interested in learning something they were unfamiliar with before visiting the site. The point of the Pierce Hacker project is to assist student in their technical indevoured queries without them having to go out of their way to find something that could be present on a website provided at the school. I believe that the lead designer chose the medium in which they did being a public website mainly because it's open to a broader audience not only for particular people but anyone needing assistance.

This week in class I learned many things such as you need to ask your audience for their input and not rush to generalizations about them in terms of their technical knowledge. Another thing I learned this week was that the class input on suggestions is something that needs to happen to make the best-chosen questions.
