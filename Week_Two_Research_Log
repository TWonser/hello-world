Research Log for Week Two Of Class.

This week in class we were prompted to create a set of instructions for a prototype Lego assembly kit. When considering how I was going to approach creating the instruction I started with making a paper copy list of things I needed in the technical document things like the required pieces to create the model, how to create each set of pieces and in which order. Creating the instructions in word was what I thought would be a fitting medium to deliver my message because it can be formatted to each page and how much I wanted to put on each of them. The addition of pictures [this]:https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&view=btop&ver=5tb04o5c4q0#attid%253Datt_16a2e78d24670084_0.35_26637ace_ea94cd5b_c6cd6c55_8242cbd4_de1f5437%25252FIMG_0405.jpg is something I knew would be key in creating the instructions for when looking at examples of technical documents it seemed to be a key feature on them.

A sense of audience when creating instructions for my Lego set I immediately though of Lego consumers buying sets to assemble or maybe someone interested in miniature battleships which is what my assembly was of. When considering the audience for the product one thing I noticed that I should have changed the language used to a more simplified version.

When considering the medium of delivery for my message like I said before It seemed more accessible to more audiences and more appropriate for these types of documents that are trying to inform their users of how to assemble the kit. The form of delivery says me as a writer prefers to be a organized, and orderly person when writing.

This week in class I believe I learned new skills to apply to instructional writing, and that time I have to put in to complete a project.
